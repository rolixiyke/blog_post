## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced structuring semantic HTML and styling a clean, modern card layout. One key learning was how subtle adjustments to box shadows and hover states can greatly improve the visual appeal of a simple component.

Example of my CSS hover effect:
css
.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.03);
}


### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:

* Explore adding animations for transitions
* Practice accessibility enhancements (e.g. focus outlines)
* Convert this layout into a React or Next.js component for reusability

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs - Box Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - Helped refine the card’s shadow styling.
* [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Great insights and feedback from other developers.
